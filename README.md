# Student Performance Predictor

**Objective:**  
Predict students' final grades based on study hours, attendance, sleep, extracurricular activities, and other features.

## Dataset  
- Source: *Students Performance Dataset*  from Kaggle.  


## Project Structure  
- `data/student_performance.csv` – main dataset  
- `notebooks/student_performance_analysis.ipynb` – exploratory analysis, model building, visualization  
- `requirements.txt` – `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, etc.

## Usage  
1. Clone the repo  
2. Download and place CSV in `/data`  
3. Run the notebook for step-by-step analysis  

## Future Improvements  
- Try Random Forest or XGBoost for better accuracy  
- Add interactivity via Flask or Streamlit  
- Expand dataset or include more features (parent education, test scores etc.)
